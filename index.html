<!-- I am passionate about building excellent software that improves the lives of 
those around me. I specialize in creating software for clients ranging from individuals 
and small-businesses all the way to large enterprise corporations. All of my work is 
produced locally from Moscow, Idaho. What would you do if you had a software expert 
available at your fingertips? -->

<!-- I am a seasoned software expert who has developed products for enterprise clients 
such as Yale University, Jimmy Johnâ€™s, and Hewlett-Packard (HP), as well as many 
venture-backed businesses. I specialize in building applications specific to the business 
needs of my clients. I have done work in software development, mobile app creation, 
front-end/back-end web, database/server management, graphic design, and video game 
development. -->

<!-- I'm a self-taught web designer and maker of digital things. I'm passionate about 
UX and product design, and work with non-profits, startups, individuals and small 
businesses to create meaningful online experiences for people. My goal is always to 
people leverage the right technology to do things better, faster and easier. I'd classify 
myself as somewhat of a generalist, and I've got chops in all phases of the design process. 
I learn by doing, and do my best work in small team settings where the core focus is 
iterative improvement. I'm a minimalist at heart, and believe that experiences don't 
have to be complex to be meaningful. I've been described by my peers as a dynamic, 
creative and motivated individual that cares about his work.-->

<!-- I've always been drawn to the overlap between design and development. My skills are 
broad: from ux to design, front end to back end development. I enjoy each aspect, and love 
building sites & mobile apps from start to finish, for clients all over the world. -->
